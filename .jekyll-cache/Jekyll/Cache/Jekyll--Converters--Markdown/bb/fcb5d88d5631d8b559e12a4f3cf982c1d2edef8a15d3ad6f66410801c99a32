				This photo was taken at Amsterdam airport by an employee of KLM airlines when I was roughly twelve years old. I was at the airport with my brother (seen in the back with his eyes popping up). He and I were at this airport alone connecting to a flight back to Detroit airport. We were alone because we were returning from a “visit” to Syria that our father took us on, thus we were in this area that is reserved for unaccompanied minors. They provide a bed to take a nap, Super Nintendo Entertainment Systems (as seen), food (Burger King french fries as provided by the attendants). This trip was not voluntary on our (my brother and I) part, as we didn’t know we were going to be on this trip for an extended amount of time. We were under the impression that we were initially flying to Florida to go to Disney World. Somehow we were convinced that we would be going to Disney Land Europe, so ignoring my skepticism we went along and went to Europe. When we eventually made it to the gate and saw the destination wasn’t DisneyLand, I asked my dad why we’re going to Damascus, which he responded that he needed to get a visa to go to DisneyLand. I felt my spider sense tingle harder but I didn’t want to create a commotion. I swallowed my fear and went along to Damascus. This wasn’t a situation where we were treated poorly, but it was a situation where I felt stuck, taken advantage of, afraid and a whole laundry lists of feelings and thoughts. We landed and were met by my father’s friend outside the airport in a (typical) Volkswagen Golf. When we began driving off, tears streamed down my face uncontrollably yet as quiet as can be, partially from anger at myself for not doing something to prevent this situation.  While in Damascus for the month(?), one reoccurring thought I’d have every day was “one more day, you can make it through one more day”. All my friends and family were missing. I was in a third world country, and didn’t know what to think.
