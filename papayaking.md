I stopped by the Papaya King on 86th in the Upper East side today (august 27, 2022). I went over there because I read news that it’s likely that they will close down soon since the building was sold to a new owner who will demolish and build a new building. Apparently, I wasn’t the only person that went there for this reason.  Everyone from every walk of life walked in to grab a hotdog and a fruit juice. I happened to arrive at a point that was a bit slower than usual so I was able to speak to the folks working. They were all part of a Bangladeshi family where the uncle was the manager on duty. They were the ones that informed me that after the news was announced, their business blew up. Everyone was coming in to get one last taste, smell, and view of the famous, iconic staple.

I hung out inside taking my time as I ate my two hotdogs and papaya fruit juice. I got a sauerkraut dog and a chili and cheese dog as these were the recommended staples to get. I put some ketchup and mustard on my dogs and immediately recognized that the ketchup was not Heinz nor Hunts but also the mustard wasn’t yellow but grainy. I’m the last person that can comment on a hotdog because I tend to like nearly all of them. I tend to keep a pack of Nathan’s or Hebrew National in my fridge (depending on which one is on sale). As I ate there on the counter against the window which should comfortably fit 2 people maybe but you’ll find 6 making their way through their dogs, the sun shines right in giving you a great view of the corner of 86th Street, one block away from the 4-5-6 subway station. You’ll see a parade of people walking by constantly which made it really difficult to get a photo without people. You also see the looks on people’s faces that are curious to try this place out. They are hungry but confused and curious, what is this neon-lit, text sprawled all over, type of place that is nestled among the high rises in the Upper East. I also look out and see a small crowd of GrubHub delivery folks, waiting for orders to pick up from there to deliver. I never would have guessed that the King would be a popular spot for folks to order delivery from.

While I ate, it felt like I was in a compact version of Katz Deli with the amount of people that came in to get a quick meal. At some point there was a small line that started because of how packed it got inside. 
When I was outside trying to photograph the shop, one guy stopped to ask if I was photographing the shop because I heard the news, to which I said yes. He then mentioned that he’s been going to Papaya King for 50 years and expressed his anger about the real estate developers that want to tear it down. His New York accented “that son of a bitch” really hit hard about how he felt about this. Another pair of older women in their 60s that I could see attending the Kandinsky gallery opening at the Guggenheim surprised me with even thicker New York accents than the prior guy popped in to check on the dogs and the prices to get some dogs later in the day. I lost track of the number of conversations I overheard outside that went along the lines of “Yeah, they are closing Papaya King. Really? Where did you hear? The news, we should stop one day and get a dog.”

I vaguely remember my first time experiencing Papaya King in the mid 2000s, mostly the neon lights and colors standing out and never thought that such a place would stick in my mind after all these years, but it did. 
The essence of New York is ingrained into here and vice versa it’s ingrained into New York. Just before I stepped outside, I showed a quick clip of Seinfeld when Kramer laments that he wants a Papaya King dog. The young guy had not heard of Seinfeld but was really amused at the fact that this dated sitcom referenced his work from so many years ago. I can now understand why Kramer wanted the Papaya King dog.
